# pingmeback-python-client v0.1.0

This is a simple client to use with [Pingmeback] (https://github.com/yanc0/pingmeback) made by YancO.
You can use this client in a cron or with [dkron] (http://dkron.io) to check the response time of your website and the validity of your SSL certificates.
The client will redirect the Pingmeback return in a backend theat you will specified (graphite by default)

## Usage

The minimal command to use this client is :
```
./pingmeback-client.py -u example.site.com -upmb host.instance.pingmeback.com 
```
You need to specify twoo parameters :
	* the '-u' wich is the url of the website that you want to check.
	* the -'upmb' wich is the url or ip to reach your Pingmeback instance.
 
You have other parameters that you can specify like :
	* the '-p' wich is a string that Pingmeback will check on your page, it's usefull to check if your website has been hacked or not
	* the '-i' wich is the insecure mod, if your SSL certificate is deprecated or broken set this to true to still have check
	* the '-t' wich is the timeout, it is the time after wich Pingmecack will tell you that your website had a timeout (default is 20 sec)
	* the '-b' wich is the backend that you want to send your data to, the default backend is set to [graphite] (http://graphite.readthedocs.io)
	* the '-s' wich is the schema under wich you want to set your data in graphite for example
	* the '-H' wich is the host of your backend, the default value is localhost
	* the '-P' wich is the port of your backend, the default value is 2003

Example to change your backend host and port :
```
./pingmeback-client.py -u example.site.com -upmb host.instance.pingmeback.com -H backend.example.com -P 42
```

Example to change the schema that you want to send to graphite :
```
